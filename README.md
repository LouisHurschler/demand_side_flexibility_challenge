## About
This repo aims as starting point for the "Characterisation of demand side flexibility"-Challenge of Energy Day Hackdays 2024.
It contains python scripts which preprocesses the data and plot some overviews.
To use the codes, you have to externally load the raw data to a folder in this repo.

## How to get started
To start, load the used date to a folder of your choice and include the folder in the .gitignore file.
You can either start analyzing the data by yourself or adapt the exicting scripts in the src-folder to your purposes.
If you want to cleanup data, for example removing irrelevant data like "min_current" or remove all data with "Frequency = 15_min",
you can use the script cleanup_data.
